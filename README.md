# RAG using LLAMA3.2

This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system utilizing the **LLAMA3.2** model to enhance response generation by incorporating relevant external information.

## Features

- **Efficient Retrieval:** Employs vector search databases (e.g., FAISS, ChromaDB) to retrieve pertinent information swiftly.
- **Advanced Generation:** Integrates the **LLAMA3.2** model to generate contextually enriched responses.
- **Optimized Performance:** Utilizes **LLAMA3.2**'s capabilities to reduce retrieval time and improve computational efficiency.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nandan-mnaik/RAG-using-LLAMA3.2.git
cd RAG-using-LLAMA3.2
```

### 2. Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher. Install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*Note: If a `requirements.txt` file is not present, manually install the necessary packages such as `transformers`, `faiss-cpu`, `chromadb`, etc.*

## Usage

### 1. Prepare Your Data:
Organize your dataset and ensure it's accessible for processing.

### 2. Run the RAG System:
Execute the main script to start the RAG process:
```bash
python RAG.py
```
*Note: Replace `RAG.py` with the actual script name if different.*

### 3. Interact with the Model:
Input queries as prompted and receive responses generated by the system.
